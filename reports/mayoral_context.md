# Mayoral Context: 2026 Combined Authority Elections

*Single-cycle descriptive analysis — not part of the Civic Lens volatility system.*

---

> Civic Lens excludes mayoral elections from its volatility measurement framework. All 10 combined authority mayoral roles on the May 2026 ballot are newly established — no prior election exists from which to compute swing, turnout delta, or calibrated uncertainty. A system that cannot be calibrated should not produce volatility outputs. Mayoral results are published separately as single-cycle descriptive analysis.
